## Iteration 2 Plan

###  Items that we should be thinking about during the second iteration of the elaboration phase.


| Rank   | Requirement (use case)                                                                | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High   | Be able to have players input their guesses on a proper UI layout (i.e., grid format) | Prioritize handling UI logicâ€”displaying the line items' text after every new guess, responding to click events (e.g., the player clicking on the first slot of the row in a grid), etc. |
| Medium | Improving time constraints                                                            | Choosing widget type, creating UI logic to display timer at a screen corner                                                                                                             |
| Low    | Adding flexibility points (i.e., pausing & quitting the game)                         | This would be a separate use case on its own to plan out, design and implement. Will also have to work with Timer Thread logic to make it sleep during the pause.                       |

- Dr Nemur and Dr Strauss are standing on stage presenting their latest findings. They are almost done.<br>
``Zoom to VIEW 2: the two scientists talking on stage``<br>
``User taps to reveal each dialogue box between the two scientists``
- Dr Nemur and Dr Strauss say their last sentence. The audience claps loudly and for a long time.<br>
``Zoom out of stage back to VIEW 1``<br>
``Play loud mass clapping sound effect that gradually dies down``
- People have stopped clapping. Do you continue to clap?<br>
